# MiniProject
Unfortunately, the project is not fully deployed. There are some problems with the connectivity inside Kubernetes. 
The only working component inside the Kubernetes is the sa_frontend using this URL: http://34.69.3.165/
The following URLs are the docker images I pushed to the Docker hub:
1. https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/malshahr92/sentiment-analysis-frontend
2. https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/malshahr92/sentiment-analysis-web-app
3. https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/malshahr92/sentiment-analysis-logic
